Most of the Cmder functionality are documented in the readme file on GitHub. We have extented help available in Cmder Wiki, also regarding integration.

If you're having trouble with anything, please have a look at the GitHub issues, or create a new one.
We'll be happy to help, but you might have a better chance to find solutions on the pages of the upstream projects. Those are:

Console emulator ~ Conemu
Cmd.exe enhancements ~ clink
Unix tools on windows ~ git for windows
